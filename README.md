# student-portal
Student Portal is a Web Application which provides an easy way for its users – primarily the students of the University 
to register for the courses of active terms, modify their course registration, and drop the course for particular term. 
The application also allows students to view all the registered courses irrespective of terms and
view their profile and edit the basic information such as address, telephone number and profile picture.


Find more detail about how to run the application and use under Wiki.

This application was developed as the part of final project for course Network Based Application Development at UNC Charlotte
